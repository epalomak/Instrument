# Instrument
School project where we had to make something using arduino nano and some of it's blocks(TWI,16bit T/C 1, etc.). We also had 
to use at least two different types of intteruptions (button and watchdog). My group made an instrument which plays a note 
depending how far your hand is from the ultra sonic sensor.

## How it works
First with the keyboard and direction from display you choose which key and octave you want.
Then simply put your hand in front of the Ultra sonic sensor. Adjusting how far your hand is (notes are played from front of the sensor
till the end of the board) you can change what note is played from chosen key and octave.
there is also a potentiometer which alternates note duration from 1/2 note to 1/32 note depending on what position the meter is.
